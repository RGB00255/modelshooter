# Model Shooter for Garry's Mod

This is the code to my very first game mod, probably. This is a SWEP (Scripted Weapon) for Garry's Mod that allows the player to pick a prop by looking and shooting at it with your secondary attack key, then you are allowed to fire that prop out of your weapon at whatever you want.

I made it for fun to learn more about scripting and possibly LUA.

Putting it up here on GitHub in case I decide to work on it in the future. Here is the todo list I made while working on it a while ago:

    Player specific model selection - Requires networking stuff
    Add fire rates
    Limit amount of models spawned in - cvar, default 30?
    Shotgun varient (ModelShotgun), would shoot nine in a square like matrix. (*new)

If you want to try it for yourself just clone this directory and put the repo folder in your addons folder. Rename it too so it does not look ugly, and you may have to delete the git related files (.gitignore, LICENSE, README.md) I am not sure if Garry's Mod is okay with those random files being in there. Good luck!
