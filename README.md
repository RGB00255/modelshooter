# Model Shooter for Garry's Mod

This is the code to my very first game mod, probably. This is a SWEP (Scripted Weapon) for Garry's Mod that allows the player to pick a prop by looking and shooting at it with your secondary attack key, then you are allowed to fire that prop out of your weapon at whatever you want.

I made it for fun to learn more about scripting and possibly LUA.

Putting it up here on GitHub in case I decide to work on it in the future. Here is the todo list I made while working on it a while ago:

    Player specific model selection - Requires networking stuff
    Add fire rates
    Limit amount of models spawned in - cvar, default 30?
    Shotgun varient (ModelShotgun), would shoot nine in a square like matrix. (*new)

If you want to try it for yourself just download from releases: https://github.com/RGB00255/modelshooter/releases/tag/release you just have to put it in your addons folder, like the good old days. :')
